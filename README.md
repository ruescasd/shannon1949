Shannon1949
============

This is a toy model of the basic ideas present in Claude Shannon's seminal [Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems](http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/files/shannon1949.pdf) published in 1949.

### How it works

Adjust the slider bars for message size (n), language entropy (Hl) and key space size (|K|), then press go. The code will generate messages, keys and ciphertexts and obtain data about the privacy properties of the cryptosystem. A plot of ciphertexts against messages shows how the three input parameters influence the information-theoretic quantities.
