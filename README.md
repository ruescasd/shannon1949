Shannon1949
============

This is a toy model of the basic ideas present in Claude Shannon's seminal [Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems](http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/files/shannon1949.pdf) published in 1949.

### How it works

Adjust the slider bars for message size (n), language entropy (Hl) and key space size (|K|), then press go. The code will generate messages, keys and ciphertexts and calculate some theoretical and statistical quantities. A plot of ciphertexts against messages shows how the three input parameters influence the information-theoretic secrecy properties of the cryptosystem.

Note that setting large values for the three parameters results in larger plaintext, ciphertext and key space, meaning more data to analyze. It may take some time.
